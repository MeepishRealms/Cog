# Curseforge Disclaimer
Although MeepishRealms Modded Expansion has an official Curseforge port, please be aware that it is not the primary focus of this project. Bug fixes, new features, and compatibility for the Modrinth version will always be considered first.

The Curseforge port was only created to help simplify updates for users who were unable or refused to switch to a Modrinth-supported platform.

Certain optional updates may also not come to Curseforge and only arrive on Modrinth.

## Missing Features
Due to the Curseforge version's status as a port, certain features may be missing or not work properly on the Curseforge pack. This may be due to technical limitations or legal issues. The following features are exclusive to the Modrinth version of the modpack.

- **Axiom**
  - Axiom is not avaliable on the Curseforge port of Modded Expansion due to legal issues. You can still join servers and LAN worlds without any issues, however you cannot access Axiom functionality in Multiplayer or Singleplayer.
- **Beta Versions**
  - Beta Versions of Modded Expansion will never be avaliable on Curseforge.
- **Server Compatbility**
  - You cannot host servers using the Curseforge port of the pack since it will cause Modrinth clients to lose functionality and potentially experience glitches.
