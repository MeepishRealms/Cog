*trident upgrades: change smithing recipe to contain a boss drop

TT's SUGGESTIONS
grapple: maybe we could do brass instead of iron to force the use of create with a simple retexture, however iron could become underused

trident upgrades: trident upgrades being in the industrial age might not be a great idea as the modern age is the age for passaging armor and tools alike. the modern age would probably be best and i think the trident passaging in a smithing table would be best

inscription table: since we retextured the spell binding table to be the inscription table, if it was meant to be obtained in the industrial age, it would essentially mean that players cant use magic at all until this point due to tomes needing to be bound to spells before use

NEW COMPAT ITEM AND USE
clay bucket
