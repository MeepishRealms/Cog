# Conditions for Joining Project Cog
By joining the official Project Cog server, you are agreeing to the following conditions in this contract. 

*By breaking these conditions, we can’t guarantee that you’ll have fun or that we will continue to allow you to join the server. You will be banned if you ruin the fun for other players who follow the rules.*

### TL;DR
Here’s a quick summary of the rules. I still recommend you read the contract since there are a few details that are not included in this distilled version.

- Be working on something other than solely progression.
- Participate in the shopping district and community.
- Don’t try to cheat the progression. Use the Create mod.
- No cheating.
- Have fun and create fun for others, not ruin it.

## Be an active member of society:
This is a building-first server. You must contribute value to the server by building, contributing to the public infrastructure, or being an active member of the community. (Preferably all) You should try your best to make your builds visually appealing. 

This condition is effort based, so don’t worry about your skill or knowledge level, just make an effort to make our server a better place.


<u>Still, we heavily recommend you build either private buildings or contribute to public ones like the railways or you inevitably will get bored in two weeks.</u>

Also, join the Discord server, since we can’t all get on all at once regularly, it allows us to socialize and build friendships outside of the game as well!

## Partake in the economy:
You must partake in the server’s economy, whether by creating a shop or service, or being a customer of said shops and services, or preferably both. 

As a member of the economy, you are forbidden from destabilizing the economy.

## You must use Create and follow the intended progression:
This is the most important condition of all. We have a custom set of progression for the game. Do not try to cheat, circumvent, or skip over parts of it. It’s long and tedious and that’s the whole point. Just… **do not.** Please use Create and have fun with it-- it’s the heart of the modpack and a great mod.

Take it slow and decorate your builds, have fun experimenting with Create. Don’t be in a rush to finish the game. It’s a building-first, automation/experimentation-second server. Speedrunning or min-maxing are forbidden. **Do not.**

## No cheating:
Just… come on. Don’t cheat, don’t use hacks, xray glitches, game-breaking bugs like zero-tick, Baritone mod, etc. Don’t install unapproved mods. 

It’s just lame.

If you struggle with building in survival, like me, go into a Creative world, create your world, and create a schematic to import back onto the server with a Schematicannon. It will recreate it, block-for-block, as long as you have the resources. We also have a special version of the client with Axiom explicitly for this purpose if you’re professional about building.

## Don’t ruin the fun:
The end goal of the server is for a peaceful, fun, and social experience for everyone. So don’t steal, kill, grief, start serious fights with people. It’s a casual place. So don’t speedrun, PVP, personally attack people, aggressively loot, create the most efficient and game-breaking farms, lag out the server intentionally, etc.

Just have fun. That’s really the only real rule besides following the intended progression.

I’m open to all suggestions for the server, modpack, community management, and rules as long as they don’t violate the philosophy of the modpack or deviate away from the focus on Create.
